this is first basic java exercise that i have written while learning , its some algorithmic basic things that i hope it helps 


to run these codes u need to install the java developement kit (jdk ) and install a code editor to check code ( netbeans , vscode , eclipse or intellij idea that i'm using ) 



hope it helps and thanks for checking it
